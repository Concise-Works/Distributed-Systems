\section{TLA\,+ \& Closing Remarks}

TLA\,+ is a high-level specification language based on temporal logic that lets you model distributed algorithms, exhaustively explore all possible states, 
and prove safety and liveness properties.  While it excels at uncovering subtle bugs and proving correctness, TLA\,+ specifications do not translate directly 
into production code---implementing a verified design remains a substantial engineering effort. 

\medskip
Recent work at Boston University on \textbf{choreography coding} aims to close this gap: engineers write global protocol descriptions in a TLA\,+-like notation, and an automated toolchain generates the per-participant code that implements the protocol.\\

\textbf{Final Note:} To the other students reading this, I hope you find these notes helpful, and no we don't need to know how to code in TLA\,+ for the exam. Just that it's not magic (can't generate code), but it can prove correctness.
