This text assumes the reader has a basic understanding of computer science and programming. It will also 
assume they are somewhat familiar with computer architecture and operating systems at a high level. The text 
will review these concepts briefly for completeness, but it will not try to teach them from scratch or provide a 
full understanding of these topics.\\
